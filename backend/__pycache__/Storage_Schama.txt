1. **Database Schema**:
   - **Messages Table**: This table stores all messages exchanged between users and the API.
     - `message_id`: Unique identifier for each message.
     - `user_id`: Identifier for the user sending the message.
     - `message_type`: Type of message (text, image, video).
     - `content`: The actual content of the message (text, URL of the image or video file).
     - `timestamp`: Timestamp indicating when the message was sent.
   - **Responses Table**: This table stores API responses to user messages.
     - `response_id`: Unique identifier for each response.
     - `message_id`: Foreign key referencing the message to which this response is associated.
     - `response_type`: Type of response (text, image, video).
     - `content`: The content of the response (text, URL of the image or video file).
     - `timestamp`: Timestamp indicating when the response was sent.

2. **Storage**:
   - **Text Messages**: Store directly in the database.
   - **Images and Videos**: Store files in a file system or a cloud storage service (like Azure, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage). Store the URL or file path in the database.
   
3. **API Implementation**:
   - When a user sends a message, store it in the database along with its type and content.
   - When the API sends a response, store it in the database along with its type, content, and reference to the original message.
   
4. **Retrieval**:
   - When the website is reopened, fetch messages and responses from the database based on timestamps or other criteria.
   - Retrieve text messages directly from the database.
   - Retrieve images and videos by accessing the URLs stored in the database.

5. **Security Considerations**:
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the chat history.
   - Ensure that sensitive information is stored securely, especially if the chat contains personal or confidential data.
